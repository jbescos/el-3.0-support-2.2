# Contributing to Eclipse Project for Expression Language

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Expression Language (also referred to as the EL) provides an important mechanism
for enabling the presentation layer (web pages) to communicate with the
application logic (managed beans). The EL is used by several JavaEE
technologies, such as JavaServer Faces technology, JavaServer Pages (JSP)
technology, and Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE (CDI). The EL can
also be used in stand-alone environments.
